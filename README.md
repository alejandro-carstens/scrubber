# Scrubber

A simple policy driven elasticsearch indices manager that "just works"

## Philosophy

Scrubber likes itself clean and easy on the eyes. It wants to be inclusive and welcoming for all walks of life, without judgement. However, Scrubber is terribly ambitious, but not at the detriment of others, rather to further us all. It may have strong opinions to stay in line with its objectives, which doesn't mean disrespect of others' ideas or work.
